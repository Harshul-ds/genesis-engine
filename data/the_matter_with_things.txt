THE MATTER WITH THINGS: OUR BRAINS, OUR DELUSIONS, AND THE UNMAKING OF THE WORLD

By Iain McGilchrist

Introduction: The Hemispheres and the Crisis of the Modern World

The human brain is divided into two hemispheres, each with its own way of attending to the world. The left hemisphere is concerned with manipulation, control, and the re-presentation of the world in abstractions. The right hemisphere is concerned with the lived world, with relationships, with context, and with the unique particularity of experience.

This division has profound implications for how we understand reality, truth, and value. The left hemisphere's way of knowing has come to dominate our culture, leading to a crisis in which we have lost touch with the richness and complexity of the world.

Chapter 1: Attention and Its Role in Shaping Reality

Attention is not just a passive process of receiving information; it actively shapes what we perceive and how we understand it. The left hemisphere pays attention to detail at the expense of context, while the right hemisphere sees the whole picture.

This difference in attention has led to a world in which we prioritize quantity over quality, analysis over synthesis, and control over understanding.

Chapter 2: The Nature of Truth

What is truth? Is it something we can grasp and manipulate, or is it something that reveals itself to us? The left hemisphere treats truth as something to be pinned down and defined, while the right hemisphere understands truth as something that emerges from relationship and context.

Chapter 3: The Crisis of Value

In our left-hemisphere dominated world, value has been reduced to utility and economic worth. We have lost the capacity to value things for their own sake, to appreciate beauty, goodness, and meaning.

Chapter 4: The Loss of Wisdom

Wisdom requires both hemispheres working together. The left hemisphere provides precision and analysis, while the right hemisphere provides context and understanding. When one dominates, wisdom is lost.

Chapter 5: The Path Forward

To heal our fractured world, we need to restore the balance between the hemispheres. This means cultivating attention to the whole, to relationships, and to the unique particularity of experience.

Conclusion: Reconnecting with Reality

The matter with things is not that they are inherently problematic, but that we have lost the capacity to see them clearly. By restoring the balance between our hemispheres, we can rediscover the richness and beauty of the world.

Key Themes:
- Hemispheric specialization and its cultural implications
- The importance of attention and context
- The crisis of truth and value in modern society
- The need for balance between analysis and synthesis
- The path to wisdom and reconnection with reality

This book challenges us to reconsider our fundamental assumptions about how we know and value the world, offering a profound critique of modern culture and a path toward healing our fractured relationship with reality.

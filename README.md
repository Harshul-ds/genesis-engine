# The Genesis Engine

### An Intelligence Platform for the Generative AI Value Chain

The Genesis Engine is a proprietary data platform that provides a ground-truth perspective on the generative AI ecosystem. While most analysis focuses on downstream model performance, our system tracks the foundational, upstream inputs—**research, engineering talent, and core infrastructure**—that are the true leading indicators of technological progress and strategic direction.

Our core thesis is that the future of AI will be determined not just by model size, but by the velocity and quality of the engineering ecosystem that supports it. We synthesize disparate, publicly available data into a unified, queryable "Knowledge Graph" to uncover the non-obvious signals that drive the industry forward.

### Key Features & Capabilities

This platform is built to answer the questions that matter most to strategists, investors, and builders in the AI space:

*   **Technology Momentum Tracking:** Identify which new architectures (e.g., State Space Models, Mixture of Experts) and optimization techniques (e.g., QLoRA, FlashAttention) are gaining real traction in both academia and enterprise engineering, based on our proprietary "Signal Velocity" metric.

*   **Organizational Capability Mapping:** Go beyond the hype to see which companies—from Big Tech labs to stealth startups—are building the most robust engineering teams, contributing to foundational open-source projects, and filing the key patents that will define the next generation of AI.

*   **Ecosystem & Dependency Analysis:** Understand the complex relationships between foundation models, frameworks, and the companies building on top of them. Discover which open-source projects are becoming critical infrastructure for the industry.

### The Architecture: A Modern Data Stack

The Genesis Engine is built with a focus on reliability, scalability, and data modeling best practices.

*   **Data Sources:** Real-time and daily data ingestion from high-signal sources including **arXiv**, **GitHub**, and the **Hugging Face Hub** via public APIs.
*   **Data Warehouse:** **Google BigQuery**.
*   **Data Transformation:** All data is rigorously cleaned, tested, and modeled into a suite of analytical marts using **dbt (data build tool)**.
*   **Orchestration:** The entire pipeline is automated via **dbt Cloud** and **GitHub Actions**.

### Accessing the Data & Insights

This project is currently under active development. Insights and curated data products will be made available through two primary channels:

1.  **The Intelligence Briefing:** A series of articles and data visualizations published on my personal site, exploring key findings from the platform.
2.  **API & Data Feeds (In Development):** A commercial API and direct data-sharing for organizations seeking real-time, granular access to the underlying data marts for proprietary analysis and investment strategies.

### About This Project

This project is an independent initiative by me, [Your Name]. I am a data professional obsessed with building systems that synthesize complex information into a clear strategic edge. My expertise lies in data engineering, advanced SQL, and identifying the non-obvious signals that predict future trends.

I'm always open to discussing the data, the methodology, or potential collaborations.
